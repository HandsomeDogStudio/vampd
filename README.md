# drupal-lamp #

A vagrant build to run a Drupal LAMP stack utilizing best practices.

We would essentially like to completely remove the complexity of managing anything related to a Drupal LAMP stack from developers and site builders. It is our intent to make this a focal point of best practices that can be applied consistently to support Drupal.  [Interact with the roadmap](https://github.com/cyberswat/drupal-lamp/issues/milestones) to help direct this project.

There are two requirements that you need to manage before you can begin.
* You need to install virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* You need to install vagrant 1.4.0 or greater http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

To install drupal-lamp run:
````
bash <(curl https://raw.github.com/cyberswat/drupal-lamp/master/setup)
````
