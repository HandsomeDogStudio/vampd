## vampd is easy to use and configure to your needs

Install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html),
[virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [ChefDK](https://downloads.getchef.com/chef-dk/).
If you are on a Mac you will also need to install X-code from the App store (for Git).

Now open your terminal of choice.

The following commands are recommended and will help us trouble shoot if future issues arise.
{% highlight text linenos=table %}
cd ~
mkdir vagrant
cd vagrant
git clone https://github.com/vampd/vampd.git
cd vampd
vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
vagrant up
{% endhighlight %}

Now, a bunch of text will run and automate the setup of your site.

During this time we recommend you edit your `/etc/hosts` file to add the proper site name and ip address so the site will resolve.

To do this open a new tab in the terminal:

`sudo nano /etc/hosts`

By default the IP address found in the Vagrantfile is 192.168.50.5 So add this line to the file below all other lines.

`192.168.50.5 example.local`

Now go back to your original terminal tab. If the process has finished, visit http://example.local and check it out, a fresh Drupal install.

And voila, you have a site installed!
